This is intended for my partner in PI Majd ABID

The libraries we use are :
	ctime to estimate CPU times.
	STL's list library for double-linked lists because we use lists to represent the graphs

To configure CMake, you should so cmake -S . -B bin
That'll create the bin foler.

To initialise : while in the topmost directory, execute "cmake -S . -B bin"
To build : run "cmake --build bin"
